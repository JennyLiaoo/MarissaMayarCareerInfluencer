        <h2>Who is Marissa Mayer and how did her contributions affect computer science?</h2></header><div class=image><img src="../../Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-AshburyCollege/CCC24/MarissaMayerCareerInfluencer/images/marissa.jpg" width="470" height="350"></div><br><br>
        <h3>Marissa Mayer's life prior to her fame</h3>
        <p>
            Marissa Mayer was born in 1975 in a town called Wausau, located in Wisconsin. <br>She lived with her father, 
            mother, and brother. Her father worked as an environmental <br>engineer; her mother was an art teacher.
        </p>
        <p>As she was choosing a college, Mayer applied to 10 schools. These schools included Harvard,<br> Yale, and Stanford.
             She got accepted to all the schools she applied for but ended up going <br>to Stanford. At first, she took pre-med
              courses. But her perspective on life changed when she took<br> an introductory computer science class. She then 
              studied symbolic systems and computer science.<br> Receiving a B.S. degree in 1997 and a M.S degree the year she 
              graduated. When she graduated <br>in 1999, she already had 12 job offers. Surprisingly, Mayer declined a high paying 
              consulting job, <br>instead, she chose one that she estimated only had a 2% chance of surviving.</p>
              
              <br> <br><br>
        <div class="ok"><h3>Working as Google's 20<sup>th</sup> employee</h3></div><div class=Google><img src="../../Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-AshburyCollege/CCC24/MarissaMayerCareerInfluencer/images/google.jpg" width="530" height="250"></div><div class="ok">
        <p>One of her job offers came from Google, at the time, a small start-up with less than 20 employees.<br> She wanted to see what 
            the place would teach her. She took the offer from Google, becoming<br> their 20th employee. She worked there for the
             next 13 years of her life. Mayer started off at<br> Google, designing its home page, and creating its product management 
             structure. She later<br> became Director of Consumer Web products. She oversaw the layout of Google’s well-known,<br> search 
             homepage. When Google went public in 2004, Mayer became rich in an instant. During<br> her time there, she got credited 
             for the increasing number of searches each day, making them<br> go from a few hundred thousand to more than a billion. 
             She was also credited with the <br>success of Google’s search engine, as well as some Google products, like, Gmail, 
             Google Maps,<br> and Google News. Unfortunately, in 2011, Mayer’s powerful run at Google came to a halt,<br> and ended.</p></div>

        <h3>Yahoo's CEO</h3>
        <p>In June of 2012, Mayer got another opportunity. Yahoo wanted Mayer to be its new CEO.<br> She got offered the job as a CEO
             and president. At the time, Yahoo was one of Google’s<br> biggest competitors. She accepted the offer and started working
              as Yahoo’s CEO. The problem <br>was, Yahoo’s revenue refused to pick up. She made a series of costly decisions that 
              did not<br> go as planned. This led to her downfall. In July 2016, it was announced that Verizon was<br> officially buying 
              Yahoo for almost 5 billion dollars. After this, Mayer resigned as the CEO.</p>

        <h3>After her resignation</h3></div><div class="ok">
        <p>Shortly after leaving Yahoo in 2017, Mayer co-founded Lumi Labs with her former Yahoo <br>colleague, Enrique Munoz Torres. 
            Google’s onetime quarters are home to Lumi Labs, a <br>15-person start-up. Lumi Labs’ main purpose is to develop smartphone 
            apps that help <br>people save a few minutes every day. For instance, machines learning certain photo-related <br>tasks. This can
             include figuring out if an image is blurry, if it is well lit, or whether it is one<br> that someone will be likely to share
              based on the history of photos that have been shared in <br>the past. This start-up is to focus “on building consumer 
              applications enabled by artificial<br> intelligence.” Lumi Labs’ first project released in 2019, called Holiday Helper, 
              is designed<br> to easily create mailing labels for gifts and cards. Mayer is pursuing new productivity-<br>enhancing 
              technology.</p></div>

        <div class=oki><h3>How has she impacted Computer Science?</h3>
        <p>As she was the 20th employee at Google, her contributions made Google super successful. Google is now the most popular
             search engine, getting tens of thousands of searches every second, and billions of searches every day. So, many people
              are using Google, it would be quite different without it. How did Google get so popular for them to get billions of 
              searches every day? This is where Marissa Mayer came to play. She was the one who affected Google’s growth, making them go from
               a hundred thousand to over a billion searches every day. If Mayer did not decide to go to Google and chose to take
                the high paying jobs, would it be as popular as it is right now? Maybe it would have sticked to the 2% survival rate.
             Nowadays, we do not just trust Google, we rely on it. Google is used for a variety of reasons, researching, it finds websites 
             for you, tells you what you need to know, and much more. Additional Google products, such as Google Maps and Gmail, have 
             aided us as well. Google Maps has helped many avoid being lost, whereas Gmail serves as an effective way to communicate.
              Marissa Mayer was credited for the success of Google’s search engine, and these two Google products.</p>
              <p>Who knows, maybe one day Lumi Labs might become super successful as well. Apps from Lumi Labs is especially suitable
                   for a lot of people who just do not have the time. Everyone likes to save a few extra minutes and spend time on
                    more enjoyable things instead of those boring moments. </p></div>
